# Private Journey Proposals

We are planning a private departure of our [Morocco Private Journey](https://www.wildernesstravel.com/trip/morocco/morocco-private-journey) itinerary. Create a React application to edit this proposal.

The trip days in the attached data include the brief itinerary from the [web page](https://www.wildernesstravel.com/trip/morocco/morocco-private-journey), and the detailed day-by-day itinerary from the attached pdf. Build a hierarchical view of the days, which we can drag and drop to arrange the itinerary. We need to be able to add, edit and delete days. As the days are arranged, re-calculate and display the date and the day of the week.

We offer 2 extensions, which can be added to the itinerary. There are also hotel options to choose between at most of the stops.
